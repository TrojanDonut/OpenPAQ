# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

OpenPAQ follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), using a versioning scheme in the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 2.1.3).

PATCH versions include backward-compatible bug fixes.

MINOR versions introduce new features in a backward-compatible manner.

MAJOR versions may introduce changes that are not backward-compatible.

Important:
With any major version update, breaking changes may occur that can affect the behavior, structure, or integration of OpenPAQ in your environment. It is strongly recommended to review the changelog and migration guide before upgrading to a new major version to ensure compatibility with your existing implementation.
